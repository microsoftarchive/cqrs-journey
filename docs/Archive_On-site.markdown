Archived notes about the On-site Conference Management

### On-site Conference Management

When Attendees arrive at the conference their names should be checked 
against an Attendee list and they should be given name badges that 
identify any additional conference events they are entitled to attend. 
They should also be given the opportunity to purchase seats for any 
additional events they would like to attend (assuming there are seats 
still available). The system that runs on-site at the conference does 
not assume that it is permanently connected to the main conference 
management system and continues to operate when it is disconnected, 
synchronizing its data with the main conference system when it 
re-establises a connection.
